# A-Maze-ing

--- 
# Description
A-Maze-ing is a technical exploration into the world of graph theory and procedural generation.   
The objective of this project is to create a robust system capable of generating "perfect" mazes (mazes where any two points are connected by exactly one path) and providing automated solutions.

The project features a modular architecture that separates the generation logic from the visual rendering, allowing for easy expansion and testing of different mathematical approaches to maze construction.

# Instructions

## Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or higher.   
pip (for dependency management).

## Execution
You can run the project using the provided Makefile:

(This will automatically check requirements, install missing dependencies, and launch the application).
```
make run
```

To clean temporary files (__pycache__), venv and others:
```
make clean
```

## Configuration File Format
The project uses a config.txt file located in the root directory. It follows a key-value pair format:
```
WIDTH=10
HEIGHT=10
ENTRY=0,0
EXIT=9,9
SEED=
ALGORITHM='bfs' or 'dfs'
OUTPUT_FILE=maze.txt
PERFECT=false
```

Colors: Supports ANSI escape codes for terminal styling.

# Technical Decisions
Maze Generation Algorithm: 

    - Randomized Prim's

## Why Prim's?

Performance: 

    - It is highly efficient for grid-based graphs.

Aesthetics: 

    - It creates a maze that looks more natural and is harder to solve by simply following one direction.

--- 

# Reusable Code

The core logic in maze_app/maze_types.py and maze_app/utils.py is strictly decoupled.  
The Bitmask Wall System using:
(NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST values) 
is designed to be imported into any grid-based game or simulation beyond this project.

## Use of AI

    - Refactoring: Optimized the render_ascii function to improve terminal refresh rates and handle complex bitmasking for walls and paths efficiently.

    - Algorithm Hardening (Debugging): Assisted in troubleshooting the "42" pattern protection logic, ensuring that the Randomized Prim's algorithm could flow around specific coordinates without breaking the visual integrity of the numbers.

    - Solver Implementation: Guided the structural design of the BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) solvers, focusing on the correct use of data structures (Queue vs. Stack) to ensure path reconstruction accuracy.

    - Generator Logic: Provided insights into the bitwise operations used to manage wall states (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST), allowing for a highly modular and memory-efficient maze representation.

# Team and Project Management
## Roles
dmena-li: Algorithm Implementation (Generator & Solver) and Rendering Engine.

rmarin-n: System Architecture (Config Parser & Validation), modulation, added features and readme.

## Planning and Evolution
Planned: Linear development (Generator -> Solver -> Render).


## Retrospective
The modular structure allowed us to work on the Solver and Generator simultaneously without merge conflicts.

## Improvements: 
Implementing a GUI using pygame instead of just ASCII would be the next logical step.

## Tools Used
    - Git/GitHub: Version control.

    - Pydantic: For configuration validation.

    - Makefile: For automation.
